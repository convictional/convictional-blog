Convictional is on a mission to enable more B2B commerce through seamless integration.
We're excited to share that our partner Apruve, the leading B2B payment gateway and credit network, have featured Convictional as a "B2B Disrupter". The B2B Disrupters series includes other leading B2B technology companies like OroCommerce (founders of Magento).

We're just getting started. [Click here to read the feature](https://blog.apruve.com/how-wholesalers-can-integrate-with-millions-of-online-stores-sell-more-and-do-less).
