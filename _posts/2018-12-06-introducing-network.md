Convictional exists to make it easier for suppliers and their retail trading partners to do business and integrate with each other. In order for that to happen, our customers need to know who is out there selling products like theirs and what companies are offering similar products.

Today, we are launching the Convictional Network. Network is a new approach to the discovery problem (how do I find suppliers and/or how do I find people who can my product?). Instead of a marketplace, where we would own relationships with the demand side and charge suppliers for access, we prefer to facilitate without actually standing in between each party. That’s why we built Network to work for both retailers and suppliers who want to either find potential sellers or source potential suppliers. Either way, the relationships you form are yours. 

Existing customers logging in to Convictional will find a new option in the main menu where you can view tens of thousands of online sellers, categorized by the platform they are on (all ones we have integrations with), the industry they are in, and the traffic the stores receive. As time goes on, we will build on this initial dataset by offering additional abilities to figure out who potential partners are and onboard them in as frictionless a way as possible. We’ll also be offering brokerage services for companies to help them source new B2B relationships. 

We’re excited to share Network with our existing and future customers. If you have questions about how to use it to make the most of your ability to integrate with new partners, reach out to sales. Since network is a beta product, and we don’t normally do betas, we are really interested to hear your thoughts on how it works for you and what we can do to improve it.

We look forward to helping grow your B2B business online even faster.
