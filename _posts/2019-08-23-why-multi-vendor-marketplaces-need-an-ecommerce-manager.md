Before Marketplace Platforms like [Convictional](https://www.convictional.com/) existed, marketplaces would have to spend tens of millions of dollars in development and operational costs to get off the ground. 

**Case Study:**

In 2018, Farfetch, a publicly-traded B2C luxury fashion marketplace spent more than $68 million alone on technology for their marketplace ([source](https://www.farfetchinvestors.com/financial-news/news-details/2019/Farfetch-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2018-Results/default.aspx)). What’s interesting is that technology represents about 70% of their total annual expenses and 11% of their revenue (they also earned over $602 million in revenue in 2018). But the good news is that it doesn’t have to cost you $68 million to launch and grow a successful marketplace. 

**Insight:**

Running a successful marketplace means investing in technology **and** growth. Failing to under-invest in one of these areas will lead to decline. 

But with the advent of Marketplace Platforms, you don’t need to hire an army of software developers in order to launch and grow a marketplace. 

Instead, you can leverage powerful marketplace automation software to do most of the heavy lifting on the back-end on your behalf, like vendor onboarding, inventory syncing, and product information syndication, while you focus on what you do best — engaging your customers. 

So if you no longer need an army of developers keeping the lights on, then who should you hire to lead the marketplace? 

Almost every modern marketplace will have an unsung team member operating the marketplace — an **Ecommerce Manager** or a **Marketplace Manager** (title nomenclature can vary). 

An Ecommerce Manager or Marketplace Manager will be the liaison between the consumer and the vendors. They operate the Marketplace Platform and merchandise the front-end of the marketplace to engage consumers. 

In this post, we’ve crafted a job description for the role that you can copy and paste to your career site. Scroll to the bottom of the post to access a downloadable version from Google Docs.
