We recently sat down with Davis Baer ([@DavisBaer](https://twitter.com/davisbaer) on Twitter), founder of [OneUp](https://www.oneupapp.io/) and contributor at [Hacker Noon](https://hackernoon.com), to discuss what we're building at [Convictional](https://www.convictional.com/) and how we're turning B2B commerce into an API. 

Roger and I frequent Hacker Noon, one of the leading technology blogs on the internet, so we're excited to share what we're working on with their audience.
