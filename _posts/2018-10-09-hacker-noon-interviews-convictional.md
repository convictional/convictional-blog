We recently sat down with Davis Baer ([@DavisBaer](https://twitter.com/davisbaer) on Twitter), founder of [OneUp](https://www.oneupapp.io/) and contributor at [Hacker Noon](https://hackernoon.com), to discuss what we're building at [Convictional](https://www.convictional.com/) and how we are turning B2B commerce into an API. 

Roger and I frequent Hacker Noon, one of the leading technology blogs on the internet. We are excited to share what we are working on with their audience.
