<p>We're excited to announce Price Lists. Price Lists make it easy to manage multiple pricing levels for the same product. Whether you use Convictional to sync with drop shippers or keep your own stores in sync you can now support shop-specific pricing levels.</p>
<p>Convictional Price Lists support multi-currency applications. You can set a Price List for each market (country) and apply a conversion factor to that Price List. When you want to update the conversion rate, you can do that in the admin and we will push it to all connected shops.</p>
<p>Convictional Price Lists allow you to set a base price markup for individual items or across all your products. If you want to setup a markup for individual items, you can do so either by a fixed dollar amount or by using a percentage. For store-wide markups, you can apply a percentage-based markup.</p>
<p>Since the majority of Convictional customers already have a base wholesale price, which is then marked up either by a dollar amount or a percentage amount depending on the product, Convictional will pull in your existing base price and perform the markup calculations on that.</p>
<p>All our existing and future customers get access to Price Lists as part of their subscription. We can't wait to see all the ways our customers apply price lists to improve your trading partner relationships and launch new markets. <a href="mailto:feedback@convictional.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Let us know what you think</a>.</p>
